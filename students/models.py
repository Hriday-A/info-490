    # IMPORTANT: ONE-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIP
    # Many students belong to one section.
    #
    # on_delete options:
    # - models.PROTECT → prevents deleting a Section if students still belong to it.
    # - models.CASCADE → deleting a Section will also delete all related students.
    #
    # Section: This is the model's name to which the current model class is referencing.
    #
    # related_name: It’s the name Django will use for the reverse relation
    # (i.e., how the parent model can access its children).
    # Without related_name: Django uses the default <modelname>_set.

    # Very Important
    #     Example: s = Section.objects.get(code="CS101-A")          # Select all the rows where the 'code' column has value = "CS101-A"
    #              s.student_set.all()                              # reverse lookup (default name); here, Student class = student_set

    # With related_name: You define your own name instead of student_set.
    #     Example: s.learners.all()                                 # give me all the students registered in 'CS101-A'
